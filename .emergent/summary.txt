The AI engineer's work, after inheriting from an initial AI, primarily focused on refining core application features and resolving critical bugs. Starting with a confirmed plan, the engineer successfully refactored the authentication system to use , including an in-place migration for existing users, and integrated push notifications. A significant task involved building a complex, automated replacement management system, complete with new backend models, algorithms, and a periodic background job for timeouts. Concurrently, the engineer meticulously debugged and corrected the Montreal 7/24 unavailability generation, adapting it to precise user-defined patterns. Frontend UI/UX was enhanced by implementing recurrence options for manual availabilities/unavailabilities and a complete redesign of the Mes disponibilités module to feature a visual, interactive calendar. Throughout these tasks, the engineer diligently resolved deployment errors (Vercel build issues) and frontend rendering bugs (CSS grid layouts, missing locale imports), ensuring application stability and usability. The trajectory concluded with a successful validation and detailed description of the Planning module.

<product_requirements>
ProFireManager is a web application designed for Canadian fire departments to manage personnel, schedules, and automated replacements. The user's requirements included:
1.  **Authentication Stability**: Resolve persistent login issues in production by refactoring the authentication system to use bcrypt, replacing SHA256, and ensuring existing users migrate seamlessly.
2.  **Indisponibilités Feature**: Implement a robust unavailability generation system based on specific firefighter patterns: Montreal 7/24 (28-day cycle with distinct working days for four teams: Vert #1, Bleu #2, Jaune #3, Rouge #4, cycle starting Jan 27, 2025) and Quebec 10/14 (pending). This includes manual input, modification, deletion, and selective reset.
3.  **UI/UX Improvements for Indisponibilités**: Display team numbers with colors in the selector. For manual input, provide both a simple calendar-click interface and advanced recurrence options (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, annual, custom frequency/interval). Replace year-based generation with date-range inputs.
4.  **Disponibilités Feature**: Implement recurrence options for manual availability input, mirroring the functionality provided for unavailabilities, while retaining the current calendar modal.
5.  **Automated Remplacement System**: Develop an intelligent, automated system where firefighters request replacements. The system identifies eligible replacements (based on equivalent/higher competence, no unavailability, grade, seniority via hire date) and notifies them via push notifications. It must handle timeouts, accept/refuse responses, and automatically update the planning. Supervisors are notified if no replacement is found or if one is secured.
6.  **Mobile App with Push Notifications**: Implement native push notifications via Capacitor/Firebase Cloud Messaging for iOS/Android, prioritizing Remplacement disponible alerts.
7.  **Mes disponibilités Module Redesign**: Overhaul the UI to be more visual and interactive, resembling the EPI module. This includes a larger, month-navigable calendar, visual legends (red cross for unavailabilities, colored pastilles for availabilities with multiple per day), and a modal on date click for viewing/modifying/deleting/adding entries. The permanent display of availability details should be removed.
8.  **Deployment & Stability**: Address recurring Vercel deployment issues and frontend rendering bugs.
9.  **Planning Module Validation**: Ensure the existing Planning module functions correctly and understand its detailed operational flow.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in validating and providing a detailed description of the Planning module. The user had explicitly asked to confirm the module's correct functionality and to describe its operation.

The AI engineer initiated this by thoroughly exploring the frontend code within  to gain a comprehensive understanding of the Planning component. This involved examining how the module manages its state, handles data fetching for assignments, displays shifts, and supports various administrative actions. The analysis confirmed that the Planning module is designed to offer a monthly view, enabling administrators and supervisors to manage both availabilities and unavailabilities for personnel, including handling recurring entries and facilitating both automatic and advanced manual assignments.

Following the code review, the  agent was invoked to perform a rigorous test of the Planning module's backend endpoints and logic. These tests successfully validated the module's functionality, ensuring its data integrity, correct assignment processing, and overall operational reliability. Upon successful validation, the AI engineer provided a comprehensive explanation to the user, detailing the Planning module's features, its role-based access for managing personnel schedules, and confirming the resolution of previous issues such as date offset corrections in the monthly view.
