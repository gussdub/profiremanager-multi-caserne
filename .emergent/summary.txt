The AI engineer's work focused on iteratively enhancing the ProFireManager application, fixing bugs, and resolving complex deployment issues across both frontend and backend. Initially, the engineer addressed user requests regarding Super Admin dashboard display, tenant status (handling  vs.  fields), and implemented comprehensive EPI management. Key technical challenges included debugging Vercel/Render production deployment synchronization, which was a recurring theme, and correcting API routes and Pydantic validation. The engineer also implemented robust tenant lifecycle management (activation/deactivation, permanent deletion), monthly revenue calculations (excluding demo tenants), and clarified the replacement module functionalities. Significant progress was made in fixing persistent login issues, correcting the password change functionality (which was a demo stub), and rectifying date offsets and assignment inconsistencies in the planning module's monthly view. The trajectory concludes with a detailed planning phase for implementing an advanced Indisponibilités (unavailabilities) feature, requiring complex scheduling logic and UI integration.

<product_requirements>
ProFireManager is a web application for Canadian fire departments (casernes) to manage personnel, schedules, and automated replacements.

**Core Functionality & Refinements:**
1.  **Multi-Tenant & Super Admin:**
    *   Tenant creation, editing, and *permanent deletion*.
    *   Super Admin dashboard displays total active/inactive casernes, personnel, and *monthly revenue (excluding demo tenants)*.
    *   Super Admin can *create initial admin accounts for new casernes*.
    *   Tenant creation fields (email, phone, address) made *optional* in frontend.
2.  **User & Profile Management:**
    *   Tenant-aware account creation with welcome emails.
    *   User profiles allow input of EPI sizes.
    *   Mes disponibilités module visible for *all part-time personnel* (admin, supervisor, employee).
    *   *Password change functionality in Mon Profil was fixed* (previously a demo stub).
3.  **Planning Module:**
    *   Enhanced shift display.
    *   Attribution tab renamed to Planning.
    *   *Admin/supervisors can add/modify/delete availabilities/unavailabilities for personnel*.
    *   *Recurring availabilities/unavailabilities* (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly with end dates) implemented.
    *   *Advanced manual assignment* was fixed.
    *   *Automatic assignment (Attribution auto) was fixed* to be idempotent, fill completely, and not exceed required personnel.
    *   *Monthly planning view date offset and assignment display were corrected*.
4.  **Deployment & Stability:**
    *   Persistent debugging of Vercel/Render deployment and synchronization issues (GitHub repo, Vercel Root Directory, caching).
    *   Backend / field discrepancies handled.
    *   CORS and API validation errors resolved.
5.  **Reporting:** Super Admin dashboard statistics were validated and corrected.
6.  **Replacements Module:** Buttons (Recherche auto, ✅, ❌) were clarified with tooltips.

**Current Major Development Focus:** Implementing a comprehensive Indisponibilités (unavailabilities) feature within the Mes disponibilités module. This involves generating unavailabilities based on specific Quebec firefighter schedules (Montreal 7/24, Quebec 10/14) and allowing manual overrides.

        -   **Super Admin Endpoints**:  endpoint added.  and  endpoints modified to handle both  and  fields for tenant status consistency. Tenant creation/update/deletion routes (, , ) were restored after accidental deletion and their paths adjusted to handle  prefix correctly.
        -   **Authentication**:  typo corrected to  (critical fix for backend crashes during admin creation). Tenant creation flow in  now correctly provides all mandatory  model fields (, , , ) and wraps SendGrid email sending in a try-except block to prevent crashes. A new endpoint  was added for changing user passwords, including old password verification and new password validation.
        -   **Tenant Data**: Monthly revenue calculation () was updated to explicitly *exclude* démonstration casernes from total personnel and revenue.
        -   **Planning/Assignments**: Endpoint paths for , , and  were corrected to include .  was added to assignment creation and conflict verification queries.  and  logic was refined to ensure idempotency (not over-assigning) and fill guards completely up to . Backend date parsing for  (and similar fields) was adjusted from  to  for consistency with ISO format. The  endpoint () was modified to retrieve assignments for the *entire month* when  is active.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in a detailed planning phase for a significant new feature: implementing Indisponibilités (unavailabilities) for all part-time personnel. This feature aims to allow users to generate unavailabilities based on two specific Quebec firefighter schedules: Montreal 7/24 and Quebec 10/14 (a complex 28-day cycle), supporting four teams (Red, Yellow, Blue, Green). Users should also be able to create random unavailabilities and modify/delete any entries, with manual modifications preserved even when re-generating schedules.

The trajectory concluded with the AI engineer posing several clarifying questions to the user to finalize the implementation plan. These questions focused on:
1.  **Generation Approach**: Confirming if a configuration-by-selection method (Option B) for generating schedules is preferred over PDF parsing.
2.  **Quebec Schedule**: How the Jour 1 for the 28-day Quebec cycle should be defined by the user (selecting a specific date vs. auto-calculation).
3.  **Shift Hours**: Confirming the exact start/end times for Day, Night, and 24h shifts (e.g., Day: 07:00-17:00, Night: 19:00-09:00, 24h: 07:00-07:00).
4.  **Implementation Order**: Whether to implement Montreal first, then Quebec, then personalized, or all at once.
5.  **Year Generation**: If the generation should cover the full year (January 1st to December 31st, 2025) or just the remainder of the current year (October 10th to December 31st, 2025).

This planning is critical before proceeding with any code changes, as the feature is complex and requires precise alignment with user expectations regarding firefighter schedules. All previous issues, including login, assignment, planning view, and administration functionalities, were addressed, but deployment synchronization and cache invalidation issues persist as an overarching operational challenge for the user.
