The AI engineer's work primarily focused on enhancing the Disponibilités module, addressing critical UI/UX issues, and implementing new features. Initial tasks involved fixing a major calendar rendering bug in Mes disponibilités caused by malformed CSS in , which led to an incorrect vertical list display instead of a grid. This was followed by resolving a login crash for part-time employees, which stemmed from unauthorized API calls to admin-specific routes (, ). The engineer then iteratively refined the sizing and centering of calendar modals (for Gérer disponibilités and Gérer indisponibilités), overcoming CSS specificity issues and Tailwind class conflicts in  through multiple adjustments and troubleshooting. A new Ajout Rapide modal was introduced for quick availability/unavailability entries. The générer undefined bug in the automated unavailability modal was fixed. Finally, the Québec 10/14 unavailability pattern was successfully implemented in the backend, and the user requested to remove the Date du premier jour du cycle field from the frontend for this pattern, hardcoding the reference dates.

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was working on the Disponibilités module and the Québec 10/14 unavailability pattern.

The Disponibilités module (including Mes disponibilités, Gérer disponibilités, Gérer indisponibilités) has undergone significant UI/UX improvements:
*   The main calendar on Mes disponibilités is now fully functional, visually complete, and responsive on mobile, addressing an initial rendering bug due to malformed CSS.
*   A new Ajout Rapide modal has been implemented, providing a quick and contextual way to add availabilities or unavailabilities for a specific day clicked on the calendar, pre-filling the date and offering essential fields.
*   The calendars within the Gérer disponibilités and Gérer indisponibilités modals have been uniformly resized to 125x125 pixels for desktop view (and maintain appropriate size for mobile), and are now perfectly centered within their modals, achieving the user's aesthetic and visibility requirements after several iterations of CSS and component-level (Tailwind) adjustments.
*   The bug causing the login page to crash for part-time employees (due to 403 errors when attempting to access admin-only API routes for users and notifications) has been fixed by introducing role-based conditional API calls.
*   The générer undefined bug in the automated unavailability modal was fixed by correctly referencing  instead of .

For the Indisponibilités feature, the Québec 10/14 pattern has been successfully implemented in the backend (), replacing the old logic with the new detailed shift schedule for four teams over a 28-day cycle, starting February 1, 2026. This implementation has been validated by backend tests.

The user's last explicit request was to remove the Date de premier jour du cycle field from the frontend for unavailability pattern generation and hardcode the reference dates in the backend to prevent users from accidentally breaking the fixed patterns.
