<analysis>
The AI engineer's work focused on iteratively enhancing the ProFireManager application, fixing bugs, and resolving complex deployment issues. Initially, the engineer addressed a user request to revert problematic Super Admin dashboard display fixes. Subsequent efforts included correcting tenant status display (handling  vs.  fields), implementing comprehensive EPI management in user profiles, renaming UI elements (e.g., Attribution to Planning), and developing robust tenant lifecycle management (activation/deactivation, permanent deletion with confirmation). A significant challenge involved debugging Vercel/Render production deployment synchronization, which was resolved by correcting GitHub repository links, Vercel root directory configurations, and addressing caching. The engineer also added monthly revenue calculations to the Super Admin dashboard. The trajectory concludes with the user requesting validation for the tenant deletion functionality and the updated statistics display.

<product_requirements>
ProFireManager is a web application for Canadian fire departments, supporting various roles to manage personnel, schedules, and automated replacements across multiple independent departments (casernes).

**Implemented Features & Refinements:**
- **Multi-Tenant & Super Admin**: Tenant creation, editing, and deletion (soft-deactivation and permanent data removal). Super Admin can create initial admin accounts for new casernes. Personnel count, billing tiers (2 for 1-30, 0 for 31-50, 7 for 51+ employees *per personnel*), and user creation limits are enforced. Tenant activation/deactivation toggle blocks login for inactive tenants.
- **User & Profile Management**: Tenant-aware account creation with welcome emails. User profiles allow input of all EPI sizes. Mes disponibilités module is visible only for part-time employees.
- **Planning Module**: Enhanced shift display (Assigned/Required ratio, color-coding, compact names). Attribution tab renamed to Planning. Configurable planning validation settings.
- **Deployment & Stability**: Production deployment via Render (backend) and Vercel (frontend). Debugged Vercel/Render synchronization issues (GitHub repo, Vercel Root Directory, caching) and backend / field discrepancies in MongoDB.
- **Reporting**: Super Admin dashboard now displays total active/inactive casernes, total personnel, and calculated monthly revenue based on active personnel.
- **Bug Fixes**: Resolved Super Admin login, Pydantic validation, email , PWA shortcut routing issues, and the display of deleted tenants.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had just implemented the calculation and display of monthly revenue on the Super Admin dashboard, and had also previously implemented the permanent deletion feature for tenants. The user reported that the démonstration caserne (which was supposedly deleted) was still present in the system, implying the deletion was not effective. Additionally, the user requested validation for the new statistics display, specifically the monthly revenue calculation. The AI engineer has received three screenshots from the user (, ,  from Chat Message 742) and is currently in the process of analyzing them to understand why the démonstration caserne is still visible and to confirm the correct display of the newly implemented statistics.
