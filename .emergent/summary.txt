<analysis>
The AI engineer systematically enhanced the ProFireManager application, starting with UI/UX harmonization and crucial feature additions across multiple modules. The Personnel module was initially refined to correct layout issues and consolidate export functionalities into a single, comprehensive modal, integrating individual and bulk export options. Extensive documentation for marketing and user manuals was generated, adapting to environment constraints.

Subsequently, the Planning module underwent significant design overhaul, incorporating KPIs, toggleable views, and styling consistent with the application's theme. A critical phase involved debugging and resolving complex backend API routing conflicts for Planning exports, successfully reordering routes to ensure correct functionality. This was followed by the design harmonization of Mes Disponibilités and Remplacements modules, strictly maintaining existing logic while integrating new KPIs, improved navigation, and fully functional PDF/Excel exports, addressing user feedback for clarity and completeness. The engineer is now poised to apply this harmonization process to the Paramètres module.

<product_requirements>
The overarching goal was to modernize and harmonize the ProFireManager application's UI/UX, enhance core functionalities, and improve reporting capabilities. Key product requirements addressed throughout the development trajectory include:
1.  **UI Harmonization:** Consistent pale red theme and modern layout across Mon Profil, Formation, EPI, Rapports, Dashboard, Personnel, Planning, Mes Disponibilités, and Remplacements modules.
2.  **Personnel Module Enhancements:** Fix long email alignment, remove per-line print buttons, implement a unified export modal (PDF/Excel) supporting all personnel and individual employee data, and resolve email/badge overlap.
3.  **Documentation Generation:** Create professional marketing/promotion text for directors and a comprehensive user manual for firefighters, including conceptual screenshots, pricing, and support details.
4.  **Planning Module Harmonization & Functionality:** Integrate KPIs (total shifts, covered/uncovered, total planned hours, coverage rate), introduce a toggleable list/calendar view, highlight auto/manual assignment, enable adding people by clicking date/shift, ensure clear visualization, and implement functional PDF/Excel exports with correct backend routing.
5.  **Mes Disponibilités Module Harmonization:** Redesign UI (header, KPIs for admins/supervisors: availability rate, # people with availability vs part-time, avg dispos, styled navigation, modals) without altering calendar functional logic. Implement working PDF/Excel exports (per person or all).
6.  **Remplacements Module Harmonization:** Redesign UI (header, KPIs, stylized tabs, list/card toggle, exports per person/all, filters by status, role-based access) without altering core functional logic. Implement working PDF/Excel exports.
7.  **Paramètres Module Harmonization:** Redesign the UI (header, KPIs, organization, buttons, forms) without altering functional logic.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Central FastAPI application for managing MongoDB models and API endpoints. It defines data models and handles authentication, CRUD operations, and complex data aggregations.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   **Planning Exports**: Added  endpoints (, ) for PDF/Excel reports of planning data. Critically, these were moved to appear *before* dynamic path routes (e.g., ) to resolve routing conflicts.
        -   **Disponibilités Exports**: Added  endpoints (, ) for PDF/Excel exports of availability data.
        -   **Remplacements Exports**: Added  endpoints (, ) for PDF/Excel exports of replacement requests, also with correct routing priority.
        -   Ensured consistency in  handling and JSON serialization practices.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The primary React application component, managing global state, rendering major functional modules, and orchestrating UI interactions and API calls.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   **Personnel**: Implemented email truncation with tooltips; removed per-line print buttons; integrated PDF/Excel exports into a single modal (supporting All personnel or Specific person via dropdown); resolved email/badge overlap; updated states (, , ) and export functions.
        -   **Planning**: Major redesign for harmonization. Added states for KPIs and view toggles (, ). Refactored JSX for a harmonized header, KPIs (total shifts, coverage), and a toggleable calendar/list view. Implemented and connected  and  functions to new export buttons.
        -   **Mes Disponibilités**: Design harmonization (header, role-based KPIs, styled calendar navigation, modals). Introduced states (, , ) and functions for exports. Fixed a bug by adding  and  to fetch  within the component for KPI calculations.
        -   **Remplacements**: Design harmonization in progress. Added states (, , , , , , ) for view toggles and filters. Replaced header, converted statistics cards to harmonized KPIs, and integrated stylized tabs. Implemented export functions and a modal.
        -   **General**: Implemented new modals for exports across Personnel, Disponibilités, and Remplacements modules.

    -   **Summary**: Contains global and component-specific CSS styles for layout, typography, and responsive design, ensuring a consistent application aesthetic.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   **Personnel**: Added styles for email truncation, tooltips, adjusted table cell widths, and z-index to correct alignment and overlap issues.
        -   **Planning**: Added new classes and styles for the harmonized header, KPIs, view toggles, and improved calendar/list layouts. Updated the color of the Assignation Manuelle Avancée button.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer successfully completed the implementation of export functionalities for the Mes Disponibilités and Remplacements modules and finished a significant part of their design harmonization.

For **Mes Disponibilités**:
*   The module's UI was harmonized with a modern header and redesigned navigation.
*   KPIs (availability rate, people with availability vs. part-time, average availabilities per part-time) were implemented to be displayed for administrators/supervisors.
*   A critical bug where the  variable was undefined for KPI calculations was resolved by fetching user data directly within the  component using  and .
*   A KPI label was clarified for better readability as per user feedback.
*   Full PDF/Excel export capabilities were implemented, including new backend API endpoints (,  in ) and corresponding frontend functions (, ) with a dedicated export modal in .

For **Remplacements**:
*   Initial design harmonization involved adding new states for view toggles and filters, replacing the header with a harmonized version, converting statistics cards into KPIs, and integrating stylized tabs.
*   Full PDF/Excel export capabilities were implemented, including new backend API endpoints (,  in ) and corresponding frontend functions (, ) with a dedicated export modal in .

The backend routing for all new export endpoints across Planning, Disponibilités, and Remplacements was carefully managed to prevent conflicts with existing dynamic routes. All frontend changes ensure that these modules now present a harmonized look and fully functional export options, completing the user's request for 100% functionality on exports.
