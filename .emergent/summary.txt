<analysis>
The AI engineer's work spanned extensive feature development, bug fixes, and mobile application deployment. Key achievements include the full implementation of the Prévention module and its advanced features, resolution of the Modifier button bug (dismissed by user), and successful generation of iOS and Android builds with updated branding. Significant effort was dedicated to troubleshooting mobile build issues (ENOSPC, Babel/ngrok/reanimated errors). The engineer also implemented dynamic tenant selection for mobile, backend endpoints for new CSV imports (EPI, Personnel, Rapports), and updated Prevention module data based on official Quebec documents. The current task is to refine the Prévention module's risk level categories.

<product_requirements>
The ProFireManager application initially focused on firefighter shift management and is expanding to include a Prévention module.
1.  **Module Prévention - Core & Advanced Features**: Implement comprehensive CRUD for inspections, non-conformities, PDF reports, dynamic grids, photo upload, detailed views, calendar, advanced reports (Excel), and automatic notifications. This module is activated per-tenant.
2.  **Existing Functionality Fixes**: Initially, address UI bugs (manual assignment) and authentication issues. The Modifier button bug in custom inspection grids was reported but later dismissed by the user as functional.
3.  **Promotional Document**: Create a sales document with tiered pricing.
4.  **Mobile Application (iOS/Android)**: Develop a React Native/Expo mobile version, including notifications that ring the user's phone, and replicate core web application functionality.
5.  **CSV Import for Mes EPI**: Implement a customizable, dynamic CSV import for Employee PPE data, mirroring the Prevention module's import, available on both web and mobile, with preview and duplicate handling.
6.  **CSV Import for Personnel and Rapports**: Implement web-only CSV imports for personnel data (fast employee onboarding) and financial data (budgets/expenses).
7.  **Prevention Module Enhancement**: Update building categories and suggest risks based on official Quebec documents (NR24-27, guide planification activité), rename cadastre to cadastre/matricule, and add a valeur foncière field.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing user requests for enhancements to the Prévention module. The user had provided two official Quebec documents (NR24-27 and guide planification activité) to standardize building categories and suggest risks. The engineer successfully extracted information from these PDFs to update the  model in  to include new categories, rename cadastre to cadastre/matricule, and add a valeur_fonciere field. A new backend endpoint  was also created to serve these official categories and risks.

However, a clarification arose regarding risks: the user specified they meant niveaux de risque (risk levels like élevé, moyen, faible) rather than types of risks. The engineer is currently re-analyzing the provided documents to extract these specific risk levels to update the backend accordingly.

<optional_next_step>
Re-analyze the provided documents to accurately define and implement the élevé, moyen, faible risk levels in the backend.
