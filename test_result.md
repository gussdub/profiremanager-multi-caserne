Changes: BACKEND - Modified generer_indisponibilites_quebec() to use hardcoded date (Feb 1, 2026) instead of date_jour_1 parameter, removed date_jour_1 parameter from function signature, removed validation check for date_jour_1 in API route, Montreal pattern already had hardcoded date (Jan 27, 2025). FRONTEND - Removed date input field from generation modal for both patterns, removed date_jour_1 from state management and API calls, removed date display from summary section.

Changes include: 1) Added bcrypt import and updated get_password_hash() to use bcrypt.hashpw(), 2) Modified verify_password() to support both bcrypt (new) and SHA256 (legacy for migration), 3) Created migrate_password_if_needed() function to automatically migrate SHA256 passwords to bcrypt on successful login, 4) Updated all login endpoints (tenant_login, super_admin_login, login_legacy) with comprehensive logging and automatic migration, 5) Enhanced change_password function with detailed logging. The system now: verifies passwords with bcrypt first, falls back to SHA256 for legacy passwords, automatically migrates SHA256 -> bcrypt on successful login (transparent to users), logs all authentication steps for debugging (hash type, verification status, migration status), creates all new passwords with bcrypt.
