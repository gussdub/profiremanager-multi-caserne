Backend implementation complete with: 1) Added 'origine' field to Disponibilite model (manuelle, montreal_7_24, quebec_10_14, personnalisee), 2) New IndisponibiliteGenerate model for generation requests, 3) Helper functions generer_indisponibilites_montreal() and generer_indisponibilites_quebec() implementing 28-day cycle logic, 4) New API route POST /{tenant_slug}/disponibilites/generer with support for team selection (Rouge, Jaune, Bleu, Vert), year selection, and optional preservation of manual modifications. Frontend implementation complete with: 1) New generation modal with horaire type selection, team selection, year selection, and Jour 1 date picker for Quebec, 2) Visual indicators showing origine badges (Montreal/Quebec/Manual), 3) Statistics card showing auto-generated count, 4) Integration with existing availability system.

Fixed HTTPException handling in backend to return correct 400 status codes instead of 500. System ready for production use."

MAIN OBJECTIVE ACHIEVED: The corrected logic now generates unavailabilities for days when team WORKS at main job (not when they don't work), as evidenced by Montreal Rouge generating exactly 91 instead of previous 274."

The /api/admin/tenants endpoint returns tenant data with all required field names matching frontend expectations. Authentication works with existing Super Admin credentials (gussdub@icloud.com).

The login blocking condition was using AND instead of OR, allowing users to login to inactive tenants. Fixed the logic in server.py lines 748 and 1699.

Fixed critical route ordering issue where Super Admin routes were defined after tenant routes, causing /api/admin/auth/me to be incorrectly matched. All 3 priority corrections now working: 1) NEW /api/admin/auth/me endpoint properly returns admin info, 2) MODIFIED /api/admin/tenants shows only Service Incendie de Shefford (demonstration caserne deleted), 3) MODIFIED /api/admin/stats returns correct statistics with Shefford in details_par_caserne.

    message: "🆕 INDISPONIBILITÉS GENERATION SYSTEM TESTING COMPLETE - Successfully tested the new automatic unavailability generation feature for Quebec firefighter schedules. All test scenarios passed: Montreal 7/24 schedule generation (274 entries), Quebec 10/14 schedule generation (260 entries), all 4 teams (Rouge, Jaune, Bleu, Vert), error handling for invalid inputs, database persistence verification. Fixed HTTPException handling bug in backend that was causing 400 errors to be returned as 500. The system correctly generates unavailabilities based on 28-day cycles with proper team offsets. API endpoint POST /{tenant_slug}/disponibilites/generer is fully functional and ready for production use."

    message: "🎯 CORRECTED LOGIC RE-TEST COMPLETE - Verified the corrected Indisponibilités Generation logic as requested in review. MAIN SUCCESS: Montreal Rouge 2025 now generates EXACTLY 91 unavailabilities (vs expected ~91) - confirming the corrected logic works perfectly. The logic now correctly generates unavailabilities for days when team WORKS at main job (not when they don't work). Quebec generation produces 105 entries (vs expected ~52) - this is mathematically correct (8 working days × 13.04 cycles) but higher than review expectation, suggesting possible discrepancy in Quebec pattern understanding. All API endpoints, authentication, user management, and database operations working correctly. The core objective of the correction has been achieved for Montreal schedules."
