All tests now pass: 1) Super Admin can update tenant with is_active=false via PUT /api/admin/tenants/{tenant_id}, 2) Login correctly returns 403 'Cette caserne est temporairement d√©sactiv√©e' for inactive tenants, 3) Re-activating tenant (is_active=true) allows login again. Used correct credentials (admin@firemanager.ca / admin123) for testing."
